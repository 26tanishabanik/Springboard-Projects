# Capstone 1 - Predicting Short Term Solar Energy Production

This folder contains the work for my first 'capstone' project. The purpose is to apply data science techniques to a dataset, including:

- Data wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis / Data storytelling
- Statistical data analysis
- Machine learning

Reports and notebooks are available for each of the above topics.

The goal of the machine learning models is to predict short term solar energy availability as a proxy for predicting solar energy production using weather forecasts. Linear regression, stochastic gradient descent, and gradient boosting regressor models have been implemented and assessed.
Please see the document "Capstone Project 1 - Final Report.pdf" for an overview and discussion of all work performed. Data available: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/ams-2014-solar-energy-prediction-contest/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ams-2014-solar-energy-prediction-contest/data)

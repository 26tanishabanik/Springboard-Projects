# Capstone 1 - Predicting Short Term Solar Energy Production

This folder contains my work for my first 'capstone' project. The goal is to apply data science techniques to a dataset, including:

- Data wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data storytelling
- Statistical data analysis
- Machine learning

The goal of the machine learning models is to predict short term solar energy availability as a proxy for predicting solar energy production using weather forecasts.
Please see the document "Capstone Project 1 - Final Report.pdf" for an overview and discussion of all work performed. Shortly, a powerpoint presentation with voiceover will be available.
